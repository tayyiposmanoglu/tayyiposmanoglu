### Hello, this is **Tayyip Osmanoğlu**

After 3.5 years of undergraduate life, I graduated from Istanbul Technical University in January 2019. I started working at ITU IT Head Office in the first years of my university education. After this working adventure, where I gained very important experiences for IT world, I decided to continue to my career at Albaraka Turk. I had worked as DevOps Engineer at Albaraka Turk Participation Bank between 2017-2020. I have had the opportunity to work in different projects in several different companies throughout my career. Nowadays, I have been working as DevOps Engineer at Payten since September 2022. Also, I'm still working hard on Cloud platforms, Container Orchestration tools such as Kubernetes, Openshift, etc. and Cloud Native technologies to improve myself in the IT world.
